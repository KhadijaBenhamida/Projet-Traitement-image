## Part I: Image Input/Output Operations

This section includes functions for opening and saving images using the matplotlib library.

## Part II: Black and White Images

This section provides functions to create black and white images, as well as functions for creating negative images.

## Part III: Grayscale Images

Functions for calculating luminance, contrast, and depth of grayscale images are included in this section.

## Part IV: Basic Operations on Grayscale Images

Basic operations such as inverting images, vertical flipping, and concatenation of grayscale images are implemented here.

## Part V: RGB Images

An example RGB image is provided along with functions for accessing pixel values.

## Part VI: Operations on RGB Images

Functions for symmetrical transformations (horizontal and vertical), converting RGB images to grayscale, and initializing random RGB images are included in this section.
